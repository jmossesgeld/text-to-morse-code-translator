After I finished the whole 100 days of Code by Angela Yu, it is about time to put my skills to the test. This mini project is the first in the series of my self made Python projects which I will be doing from now on starting today.

### Learnings
What I learned is that even for some projects as small as this one, it takes diligence to complete it properly and make it to work. A programmer should not be careless and should always assume the worst to prevent unintended problems and bugs from happening.
